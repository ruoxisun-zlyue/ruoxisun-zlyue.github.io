Hi, I'm Ruoxi Sun, a third year undergraduate student from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), minoring in Statistics and majoring in English. My research interest lies in Computational and System Neuroscience, including strategy generation, whole-brain model, decision making, and memory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sen Song](https://www.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1356/1880.htm) from [Tsinghua Library of Brain and Intelligence](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm), Tsinghua University. Also, I am studying in [Jadhav Lab](https://jadhavlab.com/) this summer, advised by [Prof. Shantanu Jadhav](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from Neuroscience Program, Brandeis University.

You can find my CV here: [Ruoxi Sun's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.docx).
